# KanBan 🗂️

## ✨ Overview  
KanBan is an interactive web-based KanBan board built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.  
It allows users to create tasks, move them across columns (**To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**), and manage them efficiently.  
The application supports **drag-and-drop**, **keyboard shortcuts**, and **dark mode**, with tasks saved in *localStorage*.

## 🚀 Features  
- ➕ Add new tasks with input field and button.  
- 🛠️ Organize tasks into three columns: **To Do**, **In Progress**, **Done**.  
- 📱 Drag and drop tasks between columns.  
- ⌨️ Keyboard shortcuts:  
  - **T** ➔ Move task to To Do  
  - **P** ➔ Move task to In Progress  
  - **D** ➔ Move task to Done  
- 🗑️ Clear all tasks with one click.  
- 🌙 Toggle between Light and Dark Mode (saved in localStorage).  
- 🔄 Auto-refresh timers for tasks in the In Progress column.
